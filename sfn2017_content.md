This is my third year presenting at Neuroscience, and in previous years, I always ended up wishing that I had put my poster online somewhere for people who might want a copy of it. This year, I finally decided to host my poster on my website (in-progress), and I thought "Why not put a little write-up of the poster too, for context?" In this case, it seems like a particularly good idea, since the data presented in the poster has me scratching my head a little. I'm hoping that if I talk to enough people about it, though, maybe I can make better sense of it. After all, that's what conferences are for, right?

Let's start with some motivation. Sometimes called the "hidden, sixth sense", proprioception (the sensation of body state), is absolutely critical for controlling movement. This becomes glaringly obvious when a person loses his or her proprioception. For an example, check out "The Man Who Lost His Body", an excellent documentary about a man who lost only his body sensation and yet can't even walk. Even the first few minutes, which you can see here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGlZpZgwnAc shows the devastating effect of losing proprioception.

Remarkably, we know very little about how this sense actually works, and what happens in the brain to actually process the sensory information. Of particular interest is primary somatosensory cortex (S1), one of the first stops in the cerebral cortex for proprioceptive signals. This area is where my research is focused. The goal of this research is to understand what this region does to process sensory signals.

But before we can dive into the neural processes of S1, it helps to understand where the inputs to this area come from. One of the things we do know about proprioception is that the signals that contribute most to this sense come from sensors in the muscles (muscle spindles) and in the tendons (Golgi tendon organs, or GTOs). There is some debate about what exactly these sensors encode, but in general, muscle spindles are thought to sense muscle length and length changes, while GTOs are thought to encode muscle force. These muscle sensor signals travel to the spinal cord and up to the brain on some of the fastest neural fibers in the body. For the limbs, these fibers synapse onto neurons in cuneate nucleus (for the arms) or gracile nucleus (for the legs). Signals from cuneate and gracile nuclei then travel to the thalamus and onward to primary somatosensory cortex. Basically, neurons in S1 are as close as three synapses away from the peripheral sensors. So the question here is: how much of what S1 does comes from what the muscles do, and how much of it is actually neural processing?

A natural starting point for understanding how neurons in this cortical area process proprioceptive signals is to examine neural activity as a monkey moves his arm around. Early studies of this area showed that most neurons tended to be tuned to a direction of hand movement. This possible hand-movement representation, of course, matches with both our conscious experience of proprioception, as well as some psychophysical data that suggests that we experience proprioception more in terms of where our hands are than in terms of where our joints are. An important caveat here, though, is that in most of these early experiments, hand movement and muscle stretches are tightly correlated. So while these early experiments did a great job of characterizing neural responses to arm movement, they did not take into account the periphery.
